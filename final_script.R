## THIS IS THE CODE FOR MY MASTER'S DISSERTATION
## STUDENT: MARIA LUIZA DIAS CAMPOS
## COURSE: BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCES MSc
## TITLE: Fertility Decision-Making in Brazil: Impact of Full-Time Education 
## on the Prevention of Early Pregnancy among Young Women in Amazon. 

## Null hypothesis: municipalities with full-time high school enrolments are not more 
## likely to have lower odds of early pregnancy rate compared to 
## municipalities without full-time high school enrolments. 

## Methodology: GLMM with Beta family estimators. The dependent variable is a ratio
## within the open interval (0,1) and the main independent variable is a dummy
## which equals to 1 if the municipality has enrolments in high school full time, 
## or 0 otherwise. 

## Conclusion: overall, municipalities with enrolments in high school full time 
## are indeed correlated with lower chances of early childbearing, compared to  
## municipalities without enrolments â€“ and this relationship is especially 
## significant for municipalities in the lower-to-medium income level group.
## Hence, this study suggests that full time education in teenage years might
## indeed play a better role in changing fertility intentions and decisions 
## compared to traditional education, rejecting the null hypothesis firstly stated.
## However, the challenges with modelling and the extremely limited dataset 
## do not allow us to assert that this will be the general case for the Amazon region,
## throughout space and time. More detailed data and causal estimation methodologies 
## are necessary to provide greater robustness to the relationship in question.

# loading dataset ---------------------------------------------------------

## I tested the following models with two different samples. 
## For the 2010-2015 dataset, I have a smaller sample but more controls.
## For the 2010-2017 dataset, I have a bigger sample but less controls. 
## The reported models are from the 2010-2015 dataset since the models were
## better adjusted for that sample.

## Pearson test 
## Null Hypothesis: there is no linear correlation between variables. 
## low p-values mean REJECTION of the null hypothesis. 
## We rejected the null, p-value is very low. There is evidence for a linear relationship. 
## However, Pearson correlation test assumes normality and it is sensitive towards outliers. 
## So I am doing Spearman correlation test.

## P-value is too low, indicating that there is a real correlation between those variables. 
## However, the correlation is negative and weak. 
## The Spearman correlation test does not consider the dependence within the sample.
## That's why we are doing the GLMM. 

# Generalized linear Mixed Model -------------------------------------------------------

# Filtering the dataset 

# I am filtering the dataset because municipalities are highly unequal between each other.
# This was an attempt of grouping municipalities that might be similar. 
# However, this was also a limitation, since the groups below are still very heterogeneous.
# Creating more sub-samples would make the samples even smaller.

## when modelling for the dispersion variables, year and municipality, the model
## changes drastically, indicating that accounting for random effects and variability
## is necessary. 
## Conclusion: even though the variability between years and municipalities are low,
## it is significant to explain the early pregnancy rate in Amazon.
